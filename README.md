# Landing-Page
I created this website using what I learned in html css and javaScript 
This site is a page for a specific organization that displays the work it provides

### What i do in this website
#### Create a variable background in home section
I save 3 images in folder and by javaScript i create function to change background randomly and call the function every 5 seconds
#### Create the navbar 
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. I select all section then i create the list of item to put all in navbar
#### Create scroll to the top button 
Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
#### Hide fixed navigation bar
Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling and after the home section
#### progress bar
I created a progress bar. When you reach the skills section, the progress begins to fill 
According to the proportion of each of them which i store it in the data set 
#### and More things I did, whether from designing the appearance or interacting with the user
### Note:
I used some ideas from chatgpt and also from osama El Zero on YouTube

This helped me do some additional things and learn new ways to do certain things. 
From what you can see in my code, I did certain things in different ways to understand the new information that I learned.

I did not copy and paste the code completely, but rather I understood it and repeated it in my own way and with my own comments
